# 2. ESP32 Development

## 2.1 Getting Started

### 2.1.1 Wiring Instruction

The example in this section uses an ESP32 microcontroller and an ESP32 expansion board for development, powered via a USB cable. The bus servo is connected to the debugging board, which is powered by an 11.1 V lithium battery. Finally, the ESP32 microcontroller and the debugging board are connected through the serial pins using Dupont wires.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * **When using Hiwonder's lithium battery, connect the battery cable with the red wire to the positive (+) terminal and the black wire to the negative (–) terminal of the DC port.**
>
> * **Before connecting the battery cables, make sure they are not already attached to the lithium battery. This prevents the risk of a short circuit caused by accidental contact between the positive and negative wires.**

### 2.1.2 Environment Configuration

Install the Arduino IDE on PC. The installation files reside under [**2. Softwares -> Arduino Environment Setup**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ItBQjWLVCJNjkWAq-7Nul_QdFbcD2dyz). Consult the associated documentation in that directory for detailed Arduino IDE usage.

## 2.2 Development Example

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Before running this example, ensure that the jumpers on the debugging board are installed on the Servo and TTL pins. Otherwise, communication will not function properly.**

### 2.2.1 Reading the Servo Status

This example displays the bus servo status through the debugger window.

**2.2.1.1 Run Program**

Double-click **Serial_Servo.ino** located at the [**01 ESP32 Development\ Program\ Serial_Servo**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W17ey8MROvUXj1uMBfneGcTAIzzmZ9Qc) folder.

After connecting the ESP32 microcontroller to the computer, choose <img src="..\_static\media\chapter_1\section_3\image1.png"style="width:300px;"/>as the development board type. Click<img src="..\_static\media\chapter_1\section_3\image2.png" style="width:50px;"/> to download the program.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_3/image3.png" class="common_img" style="width:500px;"/>

**2.2.1.2 Program Outcome**

Once the program is running, the serial debugger prints the sent data packets alongside the servo’s status frames returned from the device.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_1/section_3/image4.png" class="common_img" style="width:600px;"/>

**2.2.1.3 Program Brief Analysis**

* Import the servo communication library, define two hardware serial ports, and create a SerialServo instance using the Serial interface. Set the ESP32’s baud rate to 115200 for communication with the PC software and 1,000,000 for communication with the debugging board, with TX on pin 1 and RX on pin 0.

```
#include "HX_30HM.h"

#define RXD1 16
#define TXD1 17

SerialServo servo(Serial1, 1000000, TXD1, RXD1);
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Modify the serial port according to the actual connection, for example Serial, Serial1, or Serial2, and adjust the TX and RX pin numbers according to the hardware setup.**

* Define the parameters to send and receive.

```
ServoStatus_t status;

int16_t write_pos = 4096;
int16_t read_pos = 4096;

int16_t write_pos_offset = 100;
int16_t read_pos_offset;

uint8_t write_acc = 100;

int16_t write_speed = 1000;
int16_t read_speed;

int16_t write_pwm_speed = 1000;

uint16_t write_torque = 1000;

int16_t sync_write1[2][4] = {{1, 0, 1000, 4095},
						   {2, 0, 1000, 4095}};

int16_t sync_write2[2][4] = {{1, 0, 1000, 0},
						   {2, 0, 1000, 0}};
uint8_t read_id[] = {1, 2};
int16_t sync_read_data[2][5];

uint8_t temp;
uint8_t vol;
uint16_t cur;
int16_t read_load;
uint8_t moving_status;
```

* Initialize the main ESP32 serial port for debugging output. The serial debugger prints the sent data packets and the servo-returned data frames. The `ping` function broadcasts to search for servos, prints the detected ID numbers, and finally returns the working status of the servo.

```
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);

  status = servo.ping(0xFE);
  Serial.printf("ID:%d\n", status.id); 
  Serial.printf("状态：%X\n", status.error_byte);  
}
```

### 2.2.2 Reading the Servo Position

This example displays the current position of the bus servo through the debugger window.

**2.2.2.1 Run Program**

**2.2.2.3 Program Brief Analysis**

* Import the servo communication library. Define two hardware serial ports and create a SerialServo instance. Use the Serial port: the baud rate between ESP32 and PC software is 115200, and the baud rate with the debugging board is 1000000. TX pin is 1, RX pin is 0.

```
#include "HX_30HM.h"

#define RXD1 16
#define TXD1 17

SerialServo servo(Serial1, 1000000, TXD1, RXD1);
```

> [!NOTE]

> **Modify the serial port according to the actual connection, for example Serial, Serial1, or Serial2, and adjust the TX and RX pin numbers according to the hardware setup**.

* Define the parameters to send and receive.

```
ServoStatus_t status;

int16_t write_pos = 4096;
int16_t read_pos = 4096;

int16_t write_speed = 1000;
int16_t read_speed;

int16_t write_pwm_speed = 1000;

uint16_t write_torque = 1000;

int16_t sync_write1[2][4] = {{1, 0, 1000, 4095},
						   {2, 0, 1000, 4095}};

int16_t sync_write2[2][4] = {{1, 0, 1000, 0},
						   {2, 0, 1000, 0}};
uint8_t read_id[] = {1, 2};
int16_t sync_read_data[2][5];

uint8_t temp;
uint8_t vol;
uint16_t cur;
int16_t read_load;
uint8_t moving_status;
```

* Initialize the main ESP32 serial port for debugging output. The serial debugger prints the sent data packets and the servo-returned data frames. The `read_pos` function reads the current position value of servo ID 1 and prints it in the serial debugger.

```
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);

  status = servo.read_pos(1, &read_pos); 
  Serial.println(read_pos);
}
```

uint8_t temp;
uint8_t vol;
uint16_t cur;
int16_t read_load;
uint8_t moving_status;
```

* Initialize the main ESP32 serial port for debugging output. The serial debugger prints the sent data packets and the servo-returned data frames. The `write_pos` function sets the target position of servo ID 1, and the servo moves to that position.

```
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);

  status = servo.write_pos(1, write_pos); 
}
```

### 2.2.4 Servo Movement Control in RegWrite Mode

**2.2.4.1 Run Program**

Double-click **Serial_Servo.ino** located at the [**01 ESP32 Development\ Program\ Serial_Servo**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W17ey8MROvUXj1uMBfneGcTAIzzmZ9Qc) folder.

```
ServoStatus_t status;

int16_t write_pos = 4096;
int16_t read_pos = 4096;

int16_t write_pos_offset = 100;
int16_t read_pos_offset;

uint8_t temp;
uint8_t vol;
uint16_t cur;
int16_t read_load;
uint8_t moving_status;
```

* Initialize the main ESP32 serial port for debugging output. The serial debugger prints the sent data packets and the servo-returned data frames. The `write_reg_pos_ex` function writes the acceleration, speed, and position to the specified register of servo ID 1 without executing immediately. Execution is deferred and requires calling the `reg_action` function. After calling `reg_action`, the servo executes the previously written `write_reg_pos_ex` command and moves accordingly.

```
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);

  status = servo.write_reg_pos_ex(1, write_acc, write_speed, 0);
  status = servo.reg_action(1);
}
```

* The main ESP32 serial port is initialized for debugging output, and the serial debugger prints the sent data packets. The `sync_write_pos_ex` function sets the acceleration, speed, and position for servo IDs 1 and 2, and the servos move to the specified positions.
